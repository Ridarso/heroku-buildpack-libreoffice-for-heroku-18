# Fully working LibreOffice buildpack for the heroku-18 stack ðŸŽ‰

Shamefully simple, and utilising an official AppImage copy of LibreOffice with its dependencies directly from the vendor... a working buildpack for LibreOffice 6.x (others possibly supported via a config file) on the heroku-18 stack (others possibly supported but you may be asking for trouble if you try), after a lot of trial & error.

Made with love (and out of frustration with incompatibility between LibreOffice 6 and bare-bone heroku-18) by [@geomic](https://github.com/geomic), and with enhancements contributed in kind by [@vesatoivonen](https://github.com/vesatoivonen).

Particularly useful if you use the `libreconv` gem for document conversion to PDF in Ruby on Rails applications, and results in a manageable slug size (which will likely keep you under heroku's soft limit as an added bonus) when compared with other options.

If you need the additional capabilities of headless LibreOffice 6, particularly for closer conversion of Office files to accurate PDFs, this buildpack is for you.

Add the `heroku-buildpack-apt` buildpack to your project:
```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt.git
```

Add our LibreOffice buildpack to your project:
```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 https://github.com/BlueTeaLondon/heroku-buildpack-libreoffice-for-heroku-18.git
```

Optionally, add the following buildpack, which provides a handy combination of fonts for LibreOffice to use:
```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 3 https://github.com/debitoor/heroku-buildpack-converter-fonts.git
```

Create an `Aptfile` file in your project root with the following content (do **not** include libreoffice here):
```
libsm6
libice6
libxinerama1
libdbus-glib-1-2
libharfbuzz0b
libharfbuzz-icu0
libx11-xcb1
libxcb1
```

Optionally, create a `LibreOfficeAppImage` file in your application repository to change the installed version to something other than the latest `fresh`.
The file should contain only the full URL of a LibreOffice AppImage, from the [official links found here](https://libreoffice.soluzioniopen.com/).
For example the latest `still` can be installed with:
```
https://libreoffice.soluzioniopen.com/stable/still/LibreOffice-still.basic-x86_64.AppImage
```

Redeploy your project after committing the above, et voilÃ ...!
